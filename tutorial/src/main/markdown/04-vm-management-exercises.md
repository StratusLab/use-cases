Exercises: VM Management
========================

Marketplace
  * Search Marketplace to see what types of machines are available
  * What metadata is available for existing virtual machines? 
  * What metadata would you like to have? 
  * How do you find the StratusLab images? 
  * Get the metadata in both XML and JSON. 
  * No CLI command for searching the Marketplace database. 

Deploy Virtual Machines
  * Try different operating systems (ttylinux, Ubuntu, CentOS)
  * Run those machines through a complete lifecycle (start, access,
  terminate). 
  * Change the machine types and resources.  Verify that the requested
  resources are available.  (Information: /proc/cpuinfo,
  /proc/meminfo, ...)
  * Resources are reserved until VM is in "Done" state!

Create a Website
  * Deploy virtual machine with a web server
  * Customize landing page or other content
  * Verify that you can access the site with the customized content
  * (What packages need to be installed for each OS? Provide complete
  solution.)
